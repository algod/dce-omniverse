# DCE OmniVerse Agent-Verse Transformation Project

## Project Overview

**DCE OmniVerse** is a next-generation omnichannel agentic AI solution for pharmaceutical companies in the US, featuring 6 intelligent AI agents. The current transformation focuses on creating a futuristic "agent-verse" design that visualizes the logical business flow connecting all agents with enhanced user experience and inter-agent data flow connections.

**Target Audience**: Senior pharmaceutical commercial leaders  
**Primary Goal**: Transform existing application into a visually compelling agent-verse demonstration showcasing AI-powered pharmaceutical omnichannel planning  
**Current Status**: Active development with partial completion

## Requirements

### Core Transformation Requirements

### ðŸ”´ Critical Issues Still Blocking User Experience (P0 URGENT)
1. **"Back to Flow" Navigation Button BROKEN** 
   - Changed from Link component to router.push() - STILL NOT WORKING
   - Users cannot navigate between agents and main dashboard
   - May be client/server component issue or navigation context problem
   - BLOCKS entire application flow

2. **Color Scheme Still Dark Theme** 
   - zs-colors.ts file created but NOT applied to components
   - Application still uses dark futuristic theme instead of ZS professional light theme
   - Need white backgrounds with orange (#ec7200) and teal (#32a29b) accents
   - Inconsistent with ZS.com brand requirements

### ðŸŸ¡ Technical Investigation Required
- **Navigation Context Issue**: Need to debug why router.push('/dashboard') fails
- **Component Theme Application**: Need to systematically apply ZS color system
- **Client/Server Component Architecture**: May need 'use client' directive fixes

### âšª Next Priority (After Critical Fixes)
1. **Enhanced Q&A Chatbot** (P1) - Add real AI responses
2. **Real-time Parameter Adjustments** (P1) - Cross-agent data propagation
3. **End-to-End Flow Testing** (P1) - Comprehensive user journey validation

## Known Issues

### Critical Issues (Blocking)
1. **"Back to Flow" Navigation Button**: Not working in agent pages - prevents users from returning to main flow
2. **Incorrect Color Scheme**: Currently using dark futuristic theme instead of ZS.com light theme
3. **Wrong Background Colors**: Dark backgrounds instead of professional white/light gray

### Current Limitations
1. **Incomplete Agent Standardization**: 2 of 6 agents still need 4-tab structure implementation (AI Orchestration and Content Review)
2. **Static Q&A Responses**: Chatbot responses are currently mock data
3. **Limited Real-time Interactivity**: Parameter changes don't yet propagate across agents
4. **Performance Optimization Needed**: Some animations may cause frame drops on lower-end devices

### Technical Debt
1. **Mock Data Dependencies**: Heavy reliance on static mock data for visualizations
2. **Component Duplication**: Similar patterns across agents need refactoring
3. **State Management**: Consider implementing global state for cross-agent data flow
4. **Error Handling**: Need comprehensive error boundaries and loading states
