#### CRITICAL NEW REQUIREMENT: Continuous Automatic Animation
**Purpose**: Create an engaging, dynamic landing page that immediately shows value without requiring user interaction

**Core Animation Requirements**:
1. **Continuous Loop Animation**: Data should flow between agents continuously, starting immediately when the page loads
2. **Auto-Start on Page Load**: No button click required - animation begins automatically
3. **Subtle Always-On Connections**: Gentle, persistent connection animations between agents
4. **Real-Time Business Metrics**: Business impact metrics should update continuously in the background
5. **Living Agent-Verse**: Demonstrate the breathing, dynamic nature of the interconnected system
6. **Enhanced Button Functionality**: Keep "Visualize Business Flow" button but make it trigger a more detailed/dramatic animation sequence

**Technical Implementation for Continuous Animation**:
- **Primary Animation Loop**: Continuous data package flow every 4-5 seconds
- **Background Metrics**: Subtle counters and percentages updating every 2-3 seconds
- **Connection Pulse**: Gentle pulsing connections showing active data exchange
- **Agent Activity**: Subtle indicators showing agents are "thinking" and processing
- **Button Enhancement**: "Visualize Business Flow" triggers enhanced sequence with detailed callouts and slower timing

#### Core Enhancement Objectives
